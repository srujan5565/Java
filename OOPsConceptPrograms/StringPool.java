 String a = new String("abc");
This creates a new String object in heap, even though "abc" is already in the string pool.

So a points to a heap object.

ðŸŸ¢ String b = new String("abc");
Another new String object, also in heap.

b points to a different heap object, though contents are same.

âœ… a == b â†’ false
Because a and b point to two different objects in memory.

Even though a.equals(b) would return true, a == b returns false.

ðŸŸ¢ String c = "abc";
ðŸŸ¢ String d = "abc";
Both are string literals, and Java stores string literals in a String pool (interning).

If the same literal appears again, Java reuses the reference.

âœ… c == d â†’ true
Because both point to the same memory in the string pool â€” they are interned.
